Evaluates market sentiment by tracking 5 core indicators (NAAIM Exposure Index, Institutional Equity Allocation, Retail Net Buying, S&P 500 Forward P/E Ratio, Hedge Fund Leverage) and outputs sentiment ratings and position recommendations. This skill should be used when the user mentions topics such as US stock sentiment, market overheating, greed/fear indicators, NAAIM, institutional positioning, retail sentiment, P/E valuation bubbles, hedge fund leverage, whether to reduce positions, market risk assessment, position management advice, market top/bottom signals, etc. Even if the user simply asks "Is the US stock market risky right now?" or "Should I reduce my positions?", this skill should be triggered to provide a structured analytical framework.

# US Stock Market Sentiment Monitoring System

This skill helps you systematically analyze US stock market sentiment, determine whether the current market is in a state of greed or fear based on 5 core indicators, and provide position adjustment recommendations.

## Use Cases

Use this skill when users ask the following types of questions:
- Is the US stock market overheating / Should I reduce my positions
- What is the current market sentiment
- What are institutional and retail investor positioning levels
- Are valuations too high
- Market risk assessment

## Analytical Framework

### 5 Core Monitoring Indicators

For each indicator, use web_search to find the latest data, then evaluate according to the criteria below.

#### Indicator 1: NAAIM Exposure Index

**What it is**: The full name is National Association of Active Investment Managers Exposure Index, published weekly by the association of active investment managers in the US. It reflects the current equity exposure of active investment managers (0 = fully in cash, 100 = fully invested, can exceed 100 indicating leverage).

**Search keywords**: `NAAIM exposure index latest` or `NAAIM exposure index this week`

**Warning criteria**:
- Value > 80 and median reaches 100 → ⚠️ Warning: Institutions are near full allocation, limited room for further buying
- Value 40-80 → ✅ Normal
- Value < 40 → 📉 Institutions have significantly reduced positions, possibly a panic signal (contrarian indicator: may be an entry opportunity)

**Key interpretation**: When nearly all active fund managers are fully invested, it means "everyone who can buy has already bought," and there is a lack of new buying power to push stock prices higher.

---

#### Indicator 2: Institutional Equity Allocation

**What it is**: Data published by large asset custodians such as State Street, reflecting the percentage of equity allocation in the portfolios of global institutional investors (pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, etc.).

**Search keywords**: `State Street institutional equity allocation` or `institutional investor equity allocation percentage`

**Warning criteria**:
- At historical extreme levels since 2007 → ⚠️ Warning: Institutional allocation is too high, a classic contrarian indicator
- Moderate levels → ✅ Normal
- Historical lows → 📉 May signal a bottom

**Key interpretation**: Institutional investors as a whole are typically "late to the party" — they are most optimistic at the top (highest allocation) and most pessimistic at the bottom (lowest allocation).

---

#### Indicator 3: Retail Net Buying

**What it is**: Daily retail investor fund flow data tracked by JPMorgan, calculating the net buying amount of retail investors in the stock market.

**Search keywords**: `JPMorgan retail investor net buying` or `retail investor flows equity`

**Warning criteria**:
- Daily average buying > 85th historical percentile → ⚠️ Warning: Retail sentiment is overheated, high risk of chasing tops
- Normal levels → ✅ Normal
- Significant net selling → 📉 Panic selling (may be a contrarian buy signal)

**Key interpretation**: Retail investors tend to pile in when the market is hottest and sell when panic is greatest. Extreme retail buying often signals a short-term top.

---

#### Indicator 4: S&P 500 Forward P/E Ratio

**What it is**: The current S&P 500 index price ÷ expected earnings per share over the next 12 months (Forward Earnings). This is one of Wall Street's most commonly used valuation metrics.

**Search keywords**: `S&P 500 forward PE ratio current` or `S&P 500 forward earnings multiple`

**Warning criteria**:
- Approaching or exceeding 22-23x (near the 2000 dot-com bubble or 2021 highs) → ⚠️ Warning: Valuations are too high
- 16-20x → ✅ Reasonable range
- Below 15x → 📉 Valuations are low (may be an entry opportunity)

**Key interpretation**: A high P/E ratio means investors are paying more for each dollar of earnings. When the forward PE approaches historical peaks, it indicates that stock prices have already "priced in" a great deal of future growth expectations.

---

#### Indicator 5: Hedge Fund Leverage

**What it is**: The borrowing multiple used by hedge funds in their investments. The higher the leverage, the more money the fund borrows to amplify its investments. Typically reported by the Prime Brokerage divisions of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

**Search keywords**: `hedge fund leverage ratio Goldman Sachs` or `hedge fund gross leverage prime brokerage`

**Warning criteria**:
- Leverage at historical highs → ⚠️ Warning: Crowded positions + high leverage = volatility amplifier
- Moderate levels → ✅ Normal
- Historical lows → 📉 Deleveraging is complete, market may stabilize

**Key interpretation**: High leverage is like a "powder keg" — no problem when the market is normal, but once a pullback occurs, forced liquidations trigger chain reactions, turning minor pullbacks into major crashes.
